UseMemo()

useMemo() also helps improve performance by storing the results of expensive operations

Memoization means that if a calculation has been done before with a given input, there is no
need to do it again, because we already have the stored result of that operation
useMemo() returns a value from the computation which is then stored in a variable

we can use the useMemo Hook to memoize the expensiveOperation function. This will cause the function to only run when needed.
The useMemoHook accepts a second parameter to declare dependencies. The expensive function will only run when its dependencies have changed.
In the following example, the expensive function will only run when count is changed


UseState()

useState() is used to track in a function components
